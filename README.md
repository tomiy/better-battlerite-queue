<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The bot auto-syncs guilds, channels, roles & members between discord servers and the internal db to ensure minimal required setup: just add it to the server and launch the queue!

A `Bot Moderator` role will be created automatically. The bot recognizes this role as authorized for admin commands.

Bot Moderators will need to `/launch` the queue whenever the bot (re)starts to create the queue options.

Players will need to `/register` with an in game username and enable at least one region to queue.

Players can edit their `/profile` at any time.

During the draft, team captains can choose a champions to pick or ban from the lists available through the category buttons.

During the team's turn, if the captain is unresponsive, other team members may claim the captain role after a 1 minute timeout.

After the draft, players may report the match's outcome by voting for the option with the buttons provided.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

TODO:

- Drop during draft
- Seasons
- Champ & Map modals to edit restrictions & weights
- User profiles (w/ graphs: **low prio**)
- Leaderboards
- Manage draft sequences

MAYBE:

- Player draft
- Buttons instead of commands for most stuff
- Poll queue instead of Event driven (prevents match collisions but obligatory wait times)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/tomiy/better-battlerite-queue/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
